[ ] prove Guerini Savo theorem for Lipschitz domains
Every convex is a continuous graph over a unit ball. Mollify that graph and measure the difference.
Problem: no separation of exterior derivatives between Hodge Laplacians
Can approximate convex domains by strictly convex domains?

[ ] double check what bounds on P and PF constants are actually known in the literature 

[ ] see whether being formally correct, distinguishing points and singletons, is feasible  

[ ] Use the following result? Ziegler, Lemma 8.7: if a complex has a shelling, then this gives a shelling of the stars 

[ ] snippet on shellable, compare with paper 
A simplicial $n$-dimensional complex $\calT$ is called shellable if its $n$-simplices can be arranged in linear order $T_0, T_1, \dots$ in such a way that the subcomplex $( \cup_{i=0}^{k-1} T_i ) \cap T_k$ has dimension $n-1$ for all $k > 0$.

[o] nice snippet 
"Thus, for this lecture no knowledg is needed of the wonderful subleties of piecewise linear topology, nor of the powerful machinery of algebraic topology."

[o] Combinatorics
copy and adapt the content of Ziegler and Kozlov as necessary
The notion of shelling is taken from Ziegler's book~\cite{ziegler2012lectures}

[o] Non-trianguable manifolds?

[o] Some snippet by Verfurth and Veeser:
General results of this type for a class containing the finite element stars are not known to us. In particular and as will be illustrated in a moment, Poincar\'e constants of stars and thus of star-shaped domains may be arbitrarily large. Consequently, corresponding bounds have to incorporate some quantity that perceives the possible lack of convexity. % TODO: \cite{vohralik2005discrete}
