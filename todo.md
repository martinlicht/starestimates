"Thus, for this lecture no knowledg is needed of the wonderful subleties of piecewise linear topology, nor of the powerful machinery of algebraic topology."

A simplicial $n$-dimensional complex $\calT$ is called shellable if its $n$-simplices can be arranged in linear order $T_0, T_1, \dots$ in such a way that the subcomplex $( \cup_{i=0}^{k-1} T_i ) \cap T_k$ has dimension $n-1$ for all $k > 0$.

% TODO: discuss when we retain balls.
