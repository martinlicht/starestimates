* I have flipped some of the sections (I always find the table of contents super helpful to get the impression of the structure of the manuscript)

- I have moved Section 3 (review of PF constants) to Section 2 - I think that this is a good follow-up of the introduction

- Section 2 on triangulations only comes later as Section 3

- then PF on triangulations in the gradient case follow

- then the review of vector calculus and exterior calculus & regularized potentials

- only then shellable triangulations

* I have introduced subsections, to hopefully convey to the reader our main line of thoughts

* I have reworked the introduction

- I have tried to streamline and shorten the text

- I have introduced subsections

- I have stated from the beginning the fundamental definitions

- I have postponed some of the details (Poincaré vs Poincaré-Friedrichs), linear vs nonlinear below to Section 2

* I have tried to unify the names for the P/PF/grad/curl/div constants, at least for the introduction

* I have deleted \\ elsewhere than in the equations (LaTeX does this automatically)

* I have suggested a reworking of the proofs of Theorems 4.2 and 4.5. Actually, the potential is not constructed here step by step, it is determined already on T_0.

* I have suggested a reworking of the proof of Theorem 9.4. Hopefully this is shorter and clearer. (I am also attaching some intermediate stage of my reworking to connect the initial and final stages).

* Bibliography

- I have unified everything to MathSciNet: there was a mismatch in journal names, use of full journal names vs abbreviations, authors' names, capital lettres, repeated entries

- I have used my acm_mod.bst style: only initials of family names (full names are not always available) and html links to the papers

* I have not verified Proposition 8.3 on the reflections and deformations on shellable stars
