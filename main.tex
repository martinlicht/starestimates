\begin{abstract}
    We construct upper bounds for Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants over triangulated domains. 
    These include the Poincar\'e, Maxwell, and Friedrichs constants as special cases. 
    The main application that we envision concern computable estimates over finite element patches.

While it is known that finite element patches admit Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities, 
we are not aware of computable estimates. 
Clearly, not all local patches describe convex subdomains. 
An ostensibly more practical class of domains are domains star-shaped with respect to a ball.
Indeed, finite element patches of Lipschitz satisfy that condition. 
Over patches around interior subsimplices, the size of interior ball only depends on the shape regularity of the triangulation. However, the interior ball can be abstrarily small when the patch is around a boundary simplex at a reentrant corner, even if the mesh has good shape-regularity. 
Some interesting limit cases include the slit domain and the crossed bricks domain,
for which some finite element patches are not star-shaped with respect to any ball. 
\color{red}Our upper bounds do not depend on the angles of such reentrant corners, even in the aforementioned limit cases, but only the shape-regularity of the triangulation. \color{black}


\section{Triangulations and polytopal shellings}

We gather notions of simplicial meshes for the subsequent discussion. 

A ${k}$-dimensional \emph{simplex} $T$ is the convex hull of ${k}+1$ affinely independent points $v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{{k}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. We call these the \emph{vertices} of the simplex $T$. 
If $S$ is a simplex whose vertices are also vertices of another simplex $T$, in which case $S \subseteq T$, 
then we call $S$ a subsimplex of $T$ and we call $T$ a supersimplex of $S$. 

A family of simplices $\calT$ is a \emph{simplicial complex} or \emph{triangulation}, if its member simplices satisfy the following condition: 
(i) every subsimplex of any simplex in $\calT$ is itself part of $\calT$, and (ii) the intersection between any two simplices $T, T' \in \calT$ is either empty or a shared subsimplex of both $T$ and $T'$. 
The set of $k$-dimensional simplices in $\calT$ is denoted as $\subsimplex_{{k}}(\calT)$. 
We say that $\calT$ has dimension $n$ if it contains an $n$-dimensional simplex as a supersimplex for each simplex within it. 

Given any simplex $T$, we write $\subsimplex(T)$ for the simplicial complex that contains all subsimplices of $T$. 
More specifically, $\subsimplex_{{k}}(T) \subseteq \subsimplex(T)$ denotes the set of $k$-dimensional subsimplices of $T$. 
Whenever $\calT$ is a simplicial complex and $T \in \calT$, we let $\supsimplex(\calT,T)$ be the set of simplices in $\calT$ that contain $T$.
We write $\supsimplex_{k}(\calT,T)$ for the set of $k$-dimensional simplices in $\supsimplex(\calT,T)$. 
Additionally, the notations $\Vertices(\calT) := \subsimplex_{0}(\calT)$ and $\Edges(\calT) := \subsimplex_{1}(\calT)$ refer to the vertices and edges of the simplicial complex, respectively. Similarly, if $\calT$ is an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex, we write $\Faces(\calT) := \subsimplex_{n-1}(\calT)$ for the faces of the triangulation. 

When $\calT$ is a triangulation and $T \in \calT$, then $\calT(T)$ denotes the \emph{local patch} of $T$, which is the smallest simplicial subcomplex of $\calT$ that contains all supersimplices of $T$. Formally,
\begin{gather*}
    \calT(T) := \bigcup_{ T' \in \supsimplex(\calT,T) } \subsimplex(T').
\end{gather*}
A crucial observation is this: 
given $T, T' \in \calT$, the intersection $\calT(T) \cap \calT(T')$ is either empty or the convex closure of $T$ and $T'$ is a simplex $S \in \calT$ such that $\calT(T) \cap \calT(T') = \calT(S)$. 
\color{red}Probably needs a proof\color{black}

\begin{remark}
    Suppose that $\calT$ is a simplicial complex and that $T$ is a simplex, $T \notin \calT$, such that $\calS := T \cap |\calT|$ is a subcomplex of $\partial T$. 
    According to the simplicial Mayer-Vietoris theorem, there exists an exact sequence 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{CD}
            \dots \longrightarrow H_{k}(\calS) \longrightarrow H_{k}(\calT \oplus T) \longrightarrow H_{k}(\calT \cup T) \longrightarrow H_{k-1}(\calS) \longrightarrow\dots 
        \end{CD}
    \end{align*}
    We notice that $\calS$, $\calT$, $T$ and $\calT \cup T$ are each connected, and hence their zeroth homology groups are isomorphic to $\bbZ$. 
    By the nature of the mappings in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, we see that 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{CD}
            0 \longrightarrow H_{0}(\calS) \longrightarrow H_{0}(\calT) \oplus H_{0}(T) \longrightarrow H_{0}(\calT \cup T) \longrightarrow 0 
        \end{CD}
    \end{align*}
    is an exact sequence. 
    Moreover, $H_{k}(\calS) = H_{k}(T) 0$ for $0 < k < n-1$. Hence, for $1 < k < n-1$,
    the Mayer-Vietoris sequence includes the exact sequence 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{CD}
            0 \longrightarrow H_{k}(\calT \oplus T) \longrightarrow H_{k}(\calT \cup T) \longrightarrow 0 
        \end{CD}
    \end{align*}
    and we conclude that $H_{k}(\calT) = 0$ for $1 \leq k \leq n-1$.
    Finally, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence includes the exact sequences 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{CD}
            0 \longrightarrow H_{n}(\calT \oplus T) \longrightarrow H_{n}(\calT \cup T) \longrightarrow H_{n-1}(\calS) \longrightarrow H_{n-1}(\calT \oplus T) \longrightarrow H_{n-1}(\calT \cup T) \longrightarrow 0 
        \end{CD}
    \end{align*}
    Here, if $n=1$, it already follows that $H_{n}(\calT \oplus T) \simeq H_{n}(\calT \cup T)$.
    % We know that  $H_{0}(\calT \cup T) \simeq H_{0}(\calT) \simeq H_{0}(T) \simeq H_{0}(\calS) \simeq \bbZ$ because the respective simplicial complexes are path-connected. 
    % Hence $H_{1}(\calT) \oplus H_{1}(T) \simeq H_{1}(\calT \cup T)$. 
    % one easily sees that $H_{0}(\calT \cup T) \simeq \bbZ$ and $H_{1}(\calT) \oplus H_{1}(T) \simeq H_{1}(\calT \cup T)$. 
    If $\calS$ is isomorphic to disk,
    then $H_{n}(\calT \cup T) \simeq H_{n}(\calT \oplus T)$ and $H_{n-1}(\calT \cup T) \simeq H_{n-1}(\calT \oplus T)$ follow immediately.
    If instead $\calS$ is isomorphic to a sphere, 
    then $H_{n}(\calT \cup T) \simeq H_{n}(\calT \oplus T)$ and $H_{n-1}(\calT \cup T) \simeq H_{n-1}(\calT \oplus T)$ follow immediately.
    % Moreover, Thus $H_{n}(\calT \cup T) = H_{n}(\calT) \oplus H_{n}(\calS)$.
    % We conclude that any shellable simplicial complex has the homology groups of a disk or a sphere. 
    % NB: the zeroth homology is always free, and the n-th homology group, being the kernel of a mapping free abelian group, is free as well.
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{CD}
            0 \longrightarrow H_{1}(\calT) \oplus H_{1}(T) \longrightarrow H_{1}(\calT \cup T) \longrightarrow H_{0}(\calS) \longrightarrow H_{0}(\calT) \oplus H_{0}(T) \longrightarrow H_{0}(\calT \cup T) \longrightarrow 0 
        \end{CD}
    \end{align*}
\end{remark}

A simplicial $n$-dimensional complex $\calT$ is called shellable if its $n$-simplices can be arranged in linear order $T_0, T_1, \dots$ in such a way that the subcomplex $( \cup_{i=0}^{k-1} T_i ) \cap T_k$ has dimension $n-1$ for all $k > 0$.
