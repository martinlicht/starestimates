    We construct upper bounds for Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants over triangulated domains. 
    These includes lower estimates for the singular values of the gradient, curl, and divergence operators as special cases. 
    The main application that we envision are computable estimates over finite element patches.

\section{Introduction}\label{section:intro}

{\color{red}This introduction is a very rough draft, including snippets}

We address the construction of potentials for the gradient, the curl and the divergence operators, and more generally the exterior derivative, over triangulated domains. The potential operators are ought to satisfy bounds in Lebesgue norms that are explicitly computable in terms of the geometry. 
In particular, this yields computable upper bounds for Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities. 
For example, if $\bff \in \bfL^{2}(\Omega)$ is a square-integrable vector field over some domain $\Omega \subseteq \bbR^3$, 
we want to bound the $\bfL^2$ norm of the potential
\begin{align*}
    \argmin\limits_{ \substack{ \bfv \in \bfL^{2} \\ \curl \bfv = \bff } } \| \bfv \|_{\bfL^{2}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{\curl}
    \| \bff \|_{\bfL^{2}(\Omega)}
    .
\end{align*}
Finding a potential operator, whether it be linear or nonlinear, and bounding the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constant is generally not an easy undertaking. 
We address this topic in the special case where $\Omega$ admits a shellable triangulation.
Even though only contractible domains can admit a shellable triangulation, 
having computable upper bounds for such domains is an important step stone towards the more general case. 
For example, local patches around a simplex within a larger triangulation belong to the class of shellable triangulations.




We take the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality for the gradient of scalar functions as a conceptual point of reference.
Given a domain $\Omega \subseteq \bbR^n$ and $1 \leq p \leq \infty$,
we search for a constant $C > 0$ such that 
\begin{align*}
    \min\limits_{c\in\bbR}
    \| u - c \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{\grad,p} \| \nabla u \|_{L^p(\Omega)},
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)
    .
\end{align*}
Finding a potential of a given gradient $\nabla u$ is generally a nonlinear operation. 
The operator norm of any \emph{linear} potential construction is an upper bound for the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constant. 
Even though the existence of such a bounded linear potential construction is not evident a priori, 
picking the average-free potential 
\begin{align*}
    \Phi_{\grad}( \bff ) 
    := 
    \argmin\limits_{ \substack{ v \in W^{1,p}(\Omega) \\ \int_\Omega v = 0 } } \| \nabla v - \bff \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)},
    \quad 
    \bff \in \nabla W^{1,p}(\Omega)
\end{align*}
is a linear operation. Its operator norm is the constant in the Poincar\'e inequality 
\begin{align*}
    \| u - u_{\Omega} \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{\rm P} \| \nabla u \|_{L^p(\Omega)},
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)
    ,
\end{align*}
where $u_\Omega$ denotes the average of $u$.
Considerable research effort has gone into finding (or estimating) the optimal constants in the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities or Poincar\'e inequalities. 

The situation is less clear cut when we study the curl or divergence operators
\begin{align*}
    \curl : \bfW^{p}(\curl,\Omega) \rightarrow \bfL^{p}(\curl,\Omega),
    \qquad 
    \divergence : \bfW^{p}(\divergence,\Omega) \rightarrow L^{p}(\Omega),
\end{align*}
where we use the function spaces
\begin{align*}
    \bfW^{p}(\curl,\Omega) &:= \left\{ \bfu \in \bfL^p(\Omega) : \curl \bfu \in \bfL^p(\Omega) \right\}
    ,
    \\
    \bfW^{p}(\divergence,\Omega) &:= \left\{ \bfu \in \bfL^p(\Omega) : \divergence \bfu \in L^p(\Omega) \right\}
    .
\end{align*}
The fundamental difference is that the curl and divergence have infinite-dimensional kernels. 
{\color{red}The existence of a bounded linear potential operator is a non-trivial fact even in the Hilbert space case. }
In the Banach space case, it is not immediately evident that the kernels of these operators are complemented.
We are interested in constants for inequalities such as 
\begin{align*}
    \argmin\limits_{ \substack{ v \in W^{p}(\curl,\Omega) \\ \curl v = \bff } } \| v \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{\curl}
    \| \bff \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    ,
    \qquad 
    \argmin\limits_{ \substack{ v \in W^{p}(\divergence,\Omega) \\ \divergence v = f } } \| v \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{\divergence}
    \| f \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    ,
\end{align*}
and whether these constants can be estimated by the operator norm of linear potential operators 
\begin{align*}
    \Phi_{\curl} : \curl \bfW^{p}(\curl,\Omega) \rightarrow \bfW^{p}(\curl,\Omega)
    ,
    \quad 
    \Phi_{\divergence} : \divergence \bfW^{p}(\divergence,\Omega) \rightarrow \bfW^{p}(\divergence,\Omega)
    .
\end{align*}
We remark that seemingly not much attention has been given to the study of optimal constants in such Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities for the curl and divergence operators, 
% even if the domain is convex, 
which is in sharp contrast to the study of the gradient operator. 

We explore formulate our main results in the framework of exterior calculus.
The formalism of exterior calculus generalizes vector calculus to arbitrary dimensions and allows us to study many differential operators, such as the curl and divergence, in a unified manner. 
%
It is used ubiquitously in physics and engineering. 
%
For the purpose of our discussion, this formalisms allows us to leverage results from a larger body of literature in differential geometry and functional analysis. 
\\

Before we outline the main results of this exposition in more details, 
we first review the state of the literature on Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities on specific classes of domains. 

% Convex domains

% Domains star-shaped with respect to a ball 

% Limitations





Most research on optimal constants has addressed the case of convex domains. 
Here, the optimal constants, in terms of the domain diameter alone, are known if $p=2$ \cite{bebendorf2003note} and if $p=1$ \cite{acosta2004optimal}. 
Notably, the optimal constants $C_{\grad,p}$ for all $1 \leq p < \infty$, again in terms of only the domain diameter, are known when the domain is convex.~\cite{esposito2013poincare,ferone2012remark}.

In the Hilbert space setting when $p = 2$, Guerini and Savo~\cite{guerini2004eigenvalue} have develop lower bounds for the spectrum of the Hodge--Laplace operator, which implies upper bounds for the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constant of the exterior derivative, and hence for the curl and divergence operators.
\\

While it is known that finite element patches admit Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities, 
we are not aware of computable estimates. 
Clearly, not all local patches describe convex subdomains. 
An ostensibly more practical class of domains are domains star-shaped with respect to a ball.
Indeed, finite element patches of Lipschitz satisfy that condition. 
Over patches around interior subsimplices, the size of interior ball only depends on the shape regularity of the triangulation. However, the interior ball can be arbitrarily small when the patch is around a boundary simplex at a reentrant corner, even if the mesh has good shape-regularity. 
Some interesting limit cases include the slit domain and the crossed bricks domain,
for which some finite element patches are not star-shaped with respect to any ball. 




The main objective of the present exposition is the construction of linear potential operators the gradient, curl, and divergence satisfying explicitly computable upper bounds. This is achieved for a special class of triangulated domains,
namely domains with so-called \emph{shellable} triangulations. 
Formally, a simplicial complex is shellable if its full-dimensional simplices can be ordered in a sequence such that each such simplex in the sequence intersects the union of the previously listed simplices in a codimension one simplicial complex in the boundary of the new facet being added. 
Roughly speaking, a triangulation is shellable if the triangulation can be built, starting from a single simplex,
by successively glueing simplices to intermediate triangulations such that a combinatorial-geometric condition is satisfied:
the gluing interface is a triangulated submanifold of the boundary. 
This forces the intermediate triangulations to be particularly well-shaped. 

\color{red}Do Ern and Guermond construct a potential for the gradient over triangulations? What exactly is their approach\color{black}
\nocite{gross2004electromagnetic,hiptmair2002finite}

As a necessary subcomponent, we need to apply local Poincar\'e inequalities to select potentials. 
Again, the situation is more complicated for potentials of curls and divergences than for potentials of gradients. 
We construct gradient potentials locally over convex domains or face patches. 
We can access a considerable body of literature for gradient Poincar\'e inequalities over convex domains~\cite{bebendorf2003note}. In fact, optimal gradient Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants for the entire range $1 \leq p < \infty$ are known over convex domains. 

By contrast, the construction of curl and divergence potentials needs to repeated solve the potential problem for a vector-valued problem over simplices subject to tangential or normal boundary conditions, respectively, along a part of the boundary.
The literature is much scarcer when it comes to this. 
We are aware of work by Guerini and Savo who estimate the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants over convex domains in the Hilbert space setting, when $p=2$, subject to no boundary conditions.
By duality, that implies lower bounds for the case of full boundary conditions.
We remark that their work also shows that over convex domains in 3D:
\begin{align*}
    C_{\grad,p} \geq C_{\curl} \geq C_{\divergence}.
\end{align*}
But we need to find potentials over a simplex subject to partial boundary conditions 
and we want to address the entire $1 \leq p \leq \infty$ of Lebesgue exponents. 
The existence of such potentials is well-known yet we are not aware of any explicit constants in the literature.
Even solving the potential equation of the gradient of a simplex subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions along a single face 
has no estimates in the literature. 

An open set star-shaped with respect to a internal point is also star-shaped with respect to some open ball within the domain.
We refer to \cite{hurri1988poincare} for that perspective.

We fix this problem in two steps. 
First, we construct an auxiliary problem subject to full boundary conditions.
Second, we develop explicit estimates for the regularized Bogovski operator.

The Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities are crucial in the stability analysis of partial differential equations of vector analysis. Furthermore, their constants enter the stability and convergence theory of finite element methods. Computable and reliable estimates are a cornerstone in rigorous a~priori and a~posteriori error analysis. 
\\

\color{red}Our upper bounds do not depend on the angles of such reentrant corners, even in the aforementioned limit cases, but only the shape-regularity of the triangulation. \color{black}
\\

It is often very helpful if a simplicial complex can be created recursively, starting with a single simplex. 
In particular, this enables the inductive method of proof.
\\

Estimating Poincar\'e--Friedrichs over domains and manifolds with shellable triangulations is fundamentally restricted to spaces with the simplicial homology groups of discs and spheres. However, these estimates are important partial results. Forthcoming work will take these as a subcomponent in computing upper bounds for Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants over simplicial triangulations of general $n$-dimensional manifolds. 

\begin{remark}
    The Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constant describes the fundamental stability properties of the partial differential equation. 
    Conversely, it also implies a the lower bound for the non-zero eigenvalues of the scalar and vector Laplacian.
    In numerical methods, upper bounds for the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constant enable bound for the spectrum of stiffness matrices. 
    It also enters the a~priori error analysis.

\begin{remark}
 For reference, how the extension should work:
 suppose that $u \in H(\Omega)$ and let $f = du$.
 Suppose we have $u_1 \in H(T_1)$ with $du_1 = du$ over $T_1$. 
 We built $u'_2 \in H(T_2)$ such that 
 \begin{align*}
    \trace_F u_1 = \trace_F u'_2
 \end{align*}
 We let $u''_2 \in H(T_2)$ such that 
 \begin{align*}
    d u''_2 = f - d u'_2, \quad \trace_F u''_2 = 0
 \end{align*}
 Such $u''_2$ exists because 
 \begin{align*}
  \trace_F( f_2 - d u'_2 ) 
  &= 
  \trace_F f_1 - \trace_F d u'_2
  \\&= 
  \trace_F f_1 - \trace_F d u'_2
  \\&= 
  \trace_F d u_1 - \trace_F d u'_2
  \\&= 
  d \trace_F u_1 - d \trace_F u'_2
  \\&= 
  d \trace_F u_1 - d \trace_F u_1
  = 0
  .
 \end{align*}
 Setting $u_2 = u'_2 + u''_2$, we find 
 \begin{align*}
    d u_2 = d u'_2 + d u''_2 = d u'_2 + f - d u'_2 = f,
    \\
    \trace_F u_2 = \trace_F u'_2 = \trace_F u_1.
 \end{align*}
 That requires an extension from given partial boundary data. 
 Possible approaches:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Reflect a neighborhood and multiply with cut-off function.
  \item Take traces from patch and extend onto new simplex. 
 \end{itemize}

The remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows.
We review basic notions of triangulations in Section~\ref{section:triangulations} and provide computable upper bounds for Poincar\'e constants over triangulated domains in Section~\ref{section:poincare}.
We then review the notion of shellable triangulations of manifolds in Section~\ref{section:advancedtriangulations}.
We construct an important geometric reflection operator in Section~\ref{section:extension}
and provide computable upper bounds for Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants over shellable triangulations in Section~\ref{section:poincarefriedrichs}.


\section{Basic notions of triangulations}\label{section:triangulations}

We gather basic notions and definitions concerning simplicial meshes. 
  
A ${k}$-dimensional \emph{simplex} $T$ is the convex hull of ${k}+1$ affinely independent points $v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{{k}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. We call these the \emph{vertices} of the simplex $T$. 
If $S$ is a simplex whose vertices are also vertices of another simplex $T$, in which case $S \subseteq T$, 
then we call $S$ a \textit{subsimplex} of $T$ and we call $T$ a \textit{supersimplex} of $S$. 

The strictly positive convex combinations of the simplex' vertices are the \textit{interior} of the simplex,
and its remaining points constitute the \textit{boundary} of the simplex.
\\

A finite family of simplices $\calT$ is a \emph{simplicial complex} or \emph{triangulation}, if it satisfies the following conditions: 
(i) $\calT$ contains all the subsimplices of its members (ii) any non-empty intersection of two members of $\calT$ is a common subsimplex of each of them. 
% (i) every subsimplex of any simplex in $\calT$ is itself part of $\calT$, and (ii) the intersection between any two simplices $T, T' \in \calT$ is either empty or a shared subsimplex of both $T$ and $T'$. 
The set of $k$-dimensional simplices in $\calT$ is denoted as $\subsimplex_{{k}}(\calT)$. 
We say that a simplicial complex $\calT$ has \textit{dimension $n$} or is \textit{$n$-dimensional} if each of its simplices is a subset of an $n$-dimensional member of that complex.\footnote{We warn the reader that simplicial complexes that we call $n$-dimensional are called purely $n$-dimensional in the literature on polytopes.} 
We also write $\underlying{\calT}$ for the \textit{underlying set} of the simplicial complex $\calT$, which is defined as the union 
\[
    \underlying{\calT} := \bigcup_{ T \in \calT } T
    .
\]
We call a set \textit{trianguable} if it is the underlying set of some triangulation. 


\begin{remark}
    Our main interest in this manuscript are finite triangulations of compact sets. 
    There is another reason why we insist on the triangulation being finite: 
    if we do not require our simplicial complexes to be finite,
    then our definition would be considerably more permissive than the typical definitions in topology. 
    % 
    For example, if we allowed simplicial complex to be infinite, 
    then any subset of Euclidean space would give rise to an ``infinite $0$-dimensional complex''. But this obviously does not reflect the topology. 
    %
    A more interesting such example is this:
    the Cantor set $\calC \subseteq [0,1]$ is a compact set 
    that underlies an ``infinite $0$-dimensional simplicial complex''.
    If we place $\calC$ on the x-axis of a 2D coordinate system 
    and connect each member of $\calC$ to $(0,1)$ via a straight line segment, 
    then the resulting set is still compact, even path-connected,  
    but has an ``infinite $1$-dimensional triangulation''.
    % 
    However, none of these infinite families are simplicial complexes in the sense of topology~\cite{spanier1966homology}. 
\end{remark}


Given any simplex $T$, we write $\subsimplex(T)$ for the simplicial complex that contains all subsimplices of $T$. 
More specifically, $\subsimplex_{{k}}(T) \subseteq \subsimplex(T)$ denotes the set of $k$-dimensional subsimplices of $T$. 
Whenever $\calT$ is a simplicial complex and $T \in \calT$, we let $\supsimplex(\calT,T)$ be the set of simplices in $\calT$ that contain $T$.
We write $\supsimplex_{k}(\calT,T)$ for the set of $k$-dimensional simplices in $\supsimplex(\calT,T)$. 
Additionally, the notations $\Vertices(\calT) := \subsimplex_{0}(\calT)$ and $\Edges(\calT) := \subsimplex_{1}(\calT)$ refer to the vertices and edges of the simplicial complex, respectively. 
In practice, we not always distinguish between points and singleton simplices. % TODO: see whether being formally correct is possible 
Similarly, if $\calT$ is an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex, we write $\Faces(\calT) := \subsimplex_{n-1}(\calT)$ for the faces (codimension $1$ members) of this triangulation. 

\begin{remark}
    Our use of the term \textit{face} as is common in the finite element literature
    and is synonymous with \textit{facet} as used in the literature on polyhedral combinatorics.
    Notably, this terminology differs from the uses \textit{face} and \textit{facet} in the theory of polyhedra. 
\end{remark}

When $\calT$ is a triangulation and $T \in \calT$, then $\patch_{\calT}(T)$ denotes the \emph{local patch} or \textit{star} of $T$, 
which the simplicial subcomplex of $\calT$ that contains all supersimplices of $T$ and their subsimplices. Formally,
\begin{gather*}
    \patch_{\calT}(T) := \bigcup_{ T' \in \supsimplex(\calT,T) } \subsimplex(T').
\end{gather*}
A crucial observation is the following.

\begin{lemma}
 Let $\calT$ be an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex and let $S,S' \in \calT$.
 Then either $\calT_{n}(S) \cap \calT_{n}(S') = \emptyset$ or there exists $S'' \in \calT$
 such that $\calT_{n}(S) \cap \calT_{n}(S') = \calT_{n}(S'')$ with $S, S' \subseteq S''$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 Let $T \in \calT$ be $n$-dimensional.
 We have $T \in \patch_{\calT}(S )$ if and only if all vertices of $S $ are vertices of $T$.
 We have $T \in \patch_{\calT}(S')$ if and only if all vertices of $S'$ are vertices of $T$.
 Consequently, $T \in \patch_{\calT}(S) \cap \patch_{\calT}(S')$ if and only if $T \in \patch_{\calT}(S'')$,
 where $S'' \in \calT$ is the convex closure of $S$ and $S'$.
\end{proof}

We will use a specific notion of connectivity. 
Given an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex $\calT$, 
we call $n$-simplices $S,S' \in \calT$ \emph{strongly connected in $\calT$} if there exists a sequence $S_0=S,S_1,\dots,S'=S_m \in \calT$ such that $S_{i} \cap S_{i-1}$ is a face of both $S_{i}$ and $S_{i-1}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq m$. 
We call such a sequence a \emph{strong path} from $S$ to $S'$ in $\calT$. 
Clearly, strongly connected in $\calT$ is an equivalence relation. A \emph{strongly connected component} of $\calT$ is an equivalence class under this equivalence relation, 
and we call $\calT$ strongly connected if it has only one strongly connected component. 










\section{Constructive estimate of Poincar\'e constants}\label{section:poincare}

In this section we address the stepwise computable estimate of Poincar\'e constants of triangulated domains. As a preparatory step, we survey variations of the Poincar\'e inequality over convex domains. These results, the exposition of which we believe to be of value on its own, will serve as a building block in constructing inequalities over local patches and then triangulated domains.
\\

Let us assume that $\Omega \subseteq \bbR^{n}$ is an open set. 
Given any $p \in [1,\infty]$, we let $L^p(\Omega)$ denote the Lebesgue space over $\Omega$ with integrability exponent $p$, and we write $\bfL^p(\Omega) := L^p(\Omega)^n$ for the corresponding Lebesgue space of vector fields. 
We also write $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ for the first-order Sobolev space over $\Omega$ with integrability exponent $p$. 

We say that a domain $\Omega \subseteq \bbR^{n}$ satisfies the \emph{Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality} with exponent $p \in [1,\infty]$
if there exists a constant $C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p} \geq 0$ such that the following holds:
for every vector field $\bff \in \nabla W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ there exists $u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$
such that $\nabla u = \bff$ and 
\begin{align}\label{math:inequalitypf:gradient}
    \| u \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p} 
    \| \bff \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    .
\end{align}
Equivalently, for all $u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ we have 
\begin{align}
    \min_{ c \in \bbR } \| u - c \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p} 
    \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    .
\end{align}
We call $C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p}$ the \emph{Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constant} with exponent $p$. 

We wish to clarify the relationship between the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality, in the sense introduced above, with other inequalities that are known as Poincar\'e inequality (or also Poincar\'e--Wirtinger or Friedrichs inequality) in the literature. Given $p \in [1,\infty]$ and an open set $\Omega \subseteq \bbR^{n}$ of finite measure, 
we say that $\Omega$ satisfies the Poincar\'e inequality with exponent $p$ 
if there exists $C_{{\varnothing},\Omega,p} \geq 0$ such that 
for all $u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$
\begin{align}
    \| u - u_{\Omega} \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{\varnothing,\Omega,p} 
    \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    ,
\end{align}
where $u_{\Omega}$ is the \emph{average} of $u$ over $\Omega$, that is,
\begin{align*}
    u_{\Omega} := |\Omega|^{-1} \int_{\Omega} u.
\end{align*}
Clearly, this Poincar\'e inequality implies the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality and we have $C_{{\rm{PF}},\Omega,p} \leq C_{\varnothing,\Omega,p}$. 
Towards a converse inequality, 
let us first observe that the average of any $v \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ with $p < \infty$ satisfies the bound 
\begin{align*}
    \| v_\Omega \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}^{p}
    = 
    \int_{\Omega} \left( |\Omega|^{-1} \int_{\Omega} |v(x)| \right)^{p}
    \leq 
    \int_{\Omega} \left( |\Omega|^{-1} \int_{\Omega} |v(x)|^{p} \right)
    = 
    \| v \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}^{p}
    .
\end{align*}
Here, we have used Jensen's inequality. 
In the case $p = \infty$, any $v \in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ satisfies $\| v_\Omega \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)} \leq \| v \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}$. 
It follows that 
\begin{align*}
    \| v - v_\Omega \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)} 
    \leq
    2
    \| v \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)},
    \quad 
    v \in L^{p}(\Omega)
    .
\end{align*}
% \begin{align*}
%     \color{Emerald}
%     \| u - u_\Omega \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}^{p}
%     \leq 
%     2^{p-1} 
%     \| u \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}^{p}
%     +
%     2^{p-1} 
%     \| u_\Omega \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}^{p}
%     \leq 
%     2^{p} 
%     \| u \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}^{p}
%     .
% \end{align*}
Hence the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality implies the Poincar\'e inequality with $C_{\varnothing,\Omega,p} \leq 2 C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p}$. 

In the special case $p=2$, we always have $\| u - u_\Omega \|_{L^{2}(\Omega)} \leq \| u \|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}$ for any $v \in L^{2}(\Omega)$,
and therefore even $C_{\varnothing,\Omega,2} = C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,2}$. 
This follows from the orthogonality constant functions to average-free functions in $L^2(\Omega)$,
and it also follows from the projection estimate (see, e.g.,~\cite{xu2003some}).\footnote{\color{red}Is there a better name for this than Xu-Zikatanov estimate?}
Stern~\cite{stern2015banach} provided a generalization of the projection estimate that implies improved estimate for all $L^p$ spaces with $1 \leq p \leq \infty$:
since taking the average is a the projection onto the constants functions with unit norm, it now follows that 
\begin{align*}
    \| v - v_\Omega \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    \min\left( 2, 2^{|2/p-1|} \right)
    \| v \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    = 
    2^{|2/p-1|} 
    \| v \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    ,
    \quad 
    v \in L^p(\Omega)
    .
\end{align*}
We have $1 \leq 2^{|2/p-1|} \leq 2$ for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$.
The upper bound is only attained in the limit cases $p = 1$ and $p = \infty$, and the lower bound is only attained if $p = 2$, which reproduces the improved estimate for the Hilbert space case.
The main consequence for us is the estimate 
$C_{\varnothing,\Omega,p} \leq 2^{|2/p-1|} C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p}$.
We conclude that our notion of Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constant is equivalent to the notion of Poincar\'e constant in the literature, up to a numerical factor that only depends on $1 \leq p \leq \infty$.
\color{red} Question: can the estimate above be further improved for general $p$? Are there known results in the literature? \color{black}

There is yet another characterization of the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality that we like to point out. 
We define the potential 
\begin{align*}
    \Phi( \bff ) := \argmin\limits_{ \substack{ v \in W^{1,p}(\Omega) \\ \nabla v = \bff } } \| v \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)},
    \quad 
    \bff \in \nabla W^{1,p}(\Omega)
    .
\end{align*}
Clearly, 
\begin{align*}
    \| \Phi(\bff) \|_{L^p(\Omega)} \leq C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p} \| \bff \|_{L^p(\Omega)},
\end{align*}
and this inequality is sharp by definition of $\Phi$ provided that $C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p}$ is smallest possible constant in \eqref{math:inequalitypf:gradient}. 
However, $\Phi : \nabla W^{1,p}(\Omega) \rightarrow L^p(\Omega)$ is generally a nonlinear operator for $p \neq 2$. 
Consequently, any linear potential operator $\overline\Phi : \nabla W^{1,p}(\Omega) \rightarrow L^p(\Omega)$
satisfying $\nabla \overline\Phi( \bff ) = \bff$ for any $\bff \in \nabla W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ must have an operator norm that obeys the lower bound 
\begin{align*}
    C_{{\rm PF},\Omega,p} 
    \leq 
    \argmin\limits_{ v \in \nabla W^{1,p}(\Omega) \setminus \bbR } 
    \frac{ \| \overline\Phi(\nabla v) \|_{L^p(\Omega)} }{ \| \nabla v \|_{L^p(\Omega)} }
    .
\end{align*}
A natural choice is the linear operator $\Phi_{\varnothing} : \nabla W^{1,p}(\Omega) \rightarrow L^p(\Omega)$ that satisfies 
\begin{align*}
    \Phi_{\varnothing}( \nabla u ) = u - u_{\Omega},
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)
    .
\end{align*}
Its operator norm is just the smallest Poincar\'e constant $C_{\varnothing,\Omega,p}$.

In the light of these musings, we can clarify that our objective is the construction of linear potential operators for the gradient and later for the curl and divergence operators. 
Any Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality~\eqref{math:inequalitypf:gradient} is comparable to an upper bound for the generalized inverse of the gradient operator $\nabla : W^{1,p}(\Omega) \rightarrow L^{p}(\Omega)^{n}$. The potential reconstruction is the natural approach towards the topic when addressing the curl and divergence operators. 

\begin{remark}
    Let us further remark why the above notion of Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality suits our discussion better than the Poincar\'e inequality. 
    We want to generalize the discussion to the curl and divergence operators. 
    The kernel of the gradient is the one-dimensional space of constant functions, and is thus complemented in the Lebesgue spaces with a canonical choice of projection. 
    By contrast, the curl and divergence operators have infinite-dimensional kernels. 
    Hence, it is not clear a priori whether these kernels are complemented subspaces and admit a projection onto them, not to mention a canonical projection. 
    % The kernel of those operators is infinite-dimensional, whereas the gradient only has a one-dimensional kernel. 
    % When discussing Banach spaces, there is no canonical orthogonal projection on the kernel, unlike in the Hilbert space case, 
    % which is why the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality seems to be the more natural approach.
\end{remark}

% Our particular notion of Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality, which we interpret as an upper bound for the operator norm of a generalized inverse of the gradient is more natural for our discussion because later sections will develop analogous inequalities for the curl and the divergence operators. 



\subsection{Poincar\'e inequalities over convex domains}
% See the collection at Lemma 3.24 : https://hal.science/hal-03226049/file/volI_hal.pdf

We now collect examples for Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequalities for important special cases; see also~\cite[Lemma~3.24]{ern2021finite} for a short overview. Over convex bounded domains, it is known~\cite{bebendorf2003note,acosta2004optimal} that 
\begin{align}\label{math:acostaduran}
    \| u - u_{\Omega} \|_{L^{1}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    \frac{\diam(\Omega)}{2}
    \| \nabla u \|_{L^{1}(\Omega)}
    ,
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,2}(\Omega)
    ,
    \\
    \| u - u_{\Omega} \|_{L^{2}(\Omega)} \label{math:bebendorf}
    \leq 
    \frac{\diam(\Omega)}{\pi}
    \| \nabla u \|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}
    ,
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,2}(\Omega)
    .
\end{align}
These two estimates are the best possible in the cases $p=1$ and $p=2$, respectively, in terms of the diameter alone. 
Moreover, when $1 < p < \infty$, we know~\cite{chua2006estimates} that
\begin{align}\label{math:chuawheeden}
    \| u - u_{\Omega} \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{{\rm CW},p}
    \diam(\Omega)
    \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    ,
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)
    ,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
    C_{{\rm CW},p} 
    := 
    \sup\limits_{ v \in C^\infty([0,1]) \setminus \bbR } 
    \frac{ 
        \| v - v_{[0,1]} \|_{L^{p}([0,1])} 
    }{ 
        \| \nabla v \|_{L^{p}([0,1])} 
    }
    \leq 
    \sqrt[p]{p} 2^{1-\frac 1 p}
    =
    2
    \left( \frac p 2 \right)^{\frac 1 p}
    .
\end{align}
In addition to that,
according to~\cite{ferone2012remark,esposito2013poincare}, when $1 < p < \infty$, one can show that 
\begin{align}\label{math:esposito:pf}
    \min\limits_{ c \in \bbR }
    \| u - c \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
    \diam(\Omega)
    \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    ,
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)
    ,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
    C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
    :=
    \frac{ p \sin(\pi/p) }{ 2\pi \sqrt[p]{p-1} }
    .
\end{align}
The constant $C_{\rm{EFNT},p}$ is the best possible. 
Note that the last inequalities imply, again when $1 < p < \infty$, the Poincar\'e inequalities
\begin{align}\label{math:esposito:poincare}
    \| u - u_{\Omega} \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    2^{|1-\frac 2 p|}C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
    \diam(\Omega)
    \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
    ,
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)
    .
\end{align}
The main feature in proving these results is that the best constant in the Poincar\'e inequality is already the constant in the $1$-dimensional case. 
Finally,
since convex domains are Lipschitz domains, we may estimate 
\begin{align}\label{math:lipschitzestimate}
    \min\limits_{ c \in \bbR }
    \| u - c \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}
    \leq 
    \diam(\Omega)
    \| \nabla u \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}
    ,
    \quad 
    u \in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)
    .
\end{align}


\begin{remark}
    Let us compare the different estimates for the Poincar\'e inequality.
    In the case $2 \leq p$, 
    \begin{align*}
        2^{1-\frac 2 p}
        C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
        =
        \frac{ 2^{1-\frac 2 p} }{2}
        \frac{ \sin(\pi/p) }{ \pi/p }
        \frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt[p]{p-1} }
        =
        4^{-\frac 1 p}
        \leq
        C_{{\rm CW},p} 
        .
    \end{align*}
    In the case $2 \geq p$, 
    \begin{align*}
        2^{\frac 2 p - 1}
        C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
        =
        \frac{ 2^{\frac 2 p - 1} }{2}
        \frac{ \sin(\pi/p) }{ \pi/p }
        \frac{ 1 }{ \sqrt[p]{p-1} }
        \leq
        \frac{ 2^{\frac 2 p-1} }{2}
        =
        2^{\frac 2 p - 2}
        =
        4^{\frac 1 p - 1}
        \leq
        C_{{\rm CW},p} 
%         % 
%         .
%         4^{\frac 1 p}
%         \frac{ p \sin(\pi/p) }{ 2\pi \sqrt[p]{p-1} \cdot 2 }
%         =
%         4^{\frac 1 p}
%         \frac{ p \sin(\pi/p) }{ 4\pi \sqrt[p]{p-1} }
%         \leq 
%         \frac 1 2
        .
    \end{align*}
    It follows that \eqref{math:esposito:poincare} is tighter estimate than \eqref{math:chuawheeden} for $1 < p < \infty$.
    In the limit as $p$ goes to $1$, \eqref{math:esposito:poincare} recovers \eqref{math:acostaduran}. 
    In the limit as $p$ goes to infinity, \eqref{math:esposito:poincare} implies the Poincar\'e inequality 
    \begin{align*}
        \| u - u_{\Omega} \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}
        \leq 
        \diam(\Omega)
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}
        ,
        \quad
        u \in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)
        %
    \end{align*}
    because the $L^{\infty}$-norm is the limit of the $L^{p}$-norm. 
    Of course, this Poincar\'e inequality implies a Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality with the same constant. 
    Notably, it is much less clear whether \eqref{math:esposito:pf} implies a limit case for Lipschitz functions. 
%     Taking the \emph{informal} limit also suggest the inequality 
%     \begin{align*}
%         \min\limits_{ c \in \bbR }
%         \| u - c \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}
%         \leq 
%         \frac{d}{2}
%         \| \nabla u \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}
%         ,
%         \quad
%         u \in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)
%         ,
%     \end{align*}
%     however, we generally cannot exchange the minimum and the limit, so that is strictly informal.

\subsection{Poincar\'e inequalities over triangulated domains}

Given a gradient vector field, we can reconstructed the original scalar function up to a constant by a well-understood procedure: after fixing a starting point, we integrate the gradient vector field along lines emanating from that starting point. This defines a scalar potential. 
This shall be our inspiration for estimating the Poincar\'e constant over triangulated domains, which we achieve by an explicit construction of scalar potentials. 
After fixing a starting triangle, we construct a scalar potential for a given gradient vector field on larger and larger simplicial neighborhoods. This is achieved by a local patchwise construction of a potential and matching that local contribution to the global potential being constructed so far. 
Consequently, the overall estimate depends on the local Poincar\'e constants, the mesh quality, and the depth of the recursion. 


We have already seen a survey of Poincar\'e inequalities over convex domains. 
Slightly more generally, we are interested in such inequalities over face patches within simplicial triangulations. 
We state a geometric auxiliary lemma and an estimate of Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants over face patches 
that captures the correct asymptotic behavior as $p$ grows to infinity.


\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:volumecomparison}
    Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two $n$-simplices that share a common face $F$. Then 
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{ \vol(T_1) }{ \vol(T_2) }
        \leq 
        \frac{\diam(T_1)^n}{n! \cdot \vol(T_1)} 
        \cdot 
        \frac{\diam(T_2)^n}{n! \vol(T_2)} 
        .
    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $h_1$ and $h_2$ be the heights of $F$ in the simplices $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. 
    Then $\vol(T_1) = h_1 \vol(F)/n$ and $\vol(T_2) = h_2 \vol(F)/n$, and thus $\vol(T_1)/\vol(T_2) = h_1/h_2$.
    We estimate 
    \begin{align*}
        h_1 &\leq \diam(T_1) \leq \frac{\diam(T_1)^n}{n! \cdot \vol(T_1)} \diam(F),
        \\
        h_2 &\geq n! \cdot \frac{\vol(T_2)}{\diam(T_2)^n} \diam(T_2) \geq n! \cdot \frac{\vol(T_2)}{\diam(T_2)^n} \diam(F)
        .
    \end{align*}
    The desired estimate follows. 
    % Together with analogous estimates that swap the roles of $h_1$ and $h_2$, we find 
    % \begin{align*}
    %     \max\left( \frac{h_1}{h_2}, \frac{h_2}{h_1} \right)
    %     \leq 
    %     \frac{\diam(T_1)^n}{n! \cdot \vol(T_1)} 
    %     \cdot 
    %     \frac{\diam(T_2)^n}{n! \vol(T_2)} 
    %     .
    % \end{align*}
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
    Whenever $T$ is an $n$-dimensional simplex, the ratio $\diam(T)^n / \vol(T)$ measures the ``shape quality'' of a simplex and is instance of a so-called \emph{shape measure}. 
    This geometric ratio equals what is known as \emph{fatness} in differential geometry~\cite{cheeger1984curvature} and is precisely the reciprocal of the \emph{fullness} discussed by Whitney~\cite{whitney2012geometric}. 
    The \emph{thickness} of a simplex is the ratio of its smallest height to its diameter~\cite{munkres2016elementary}.
    Alternative shape measures have been used throughout the literature of numerical analysis and computational geometry to quantify the quality of simplices.
    One example, commonly referenced in finite element literature, is the ratio of the diameter and the radius of the largest inscribed circle of a simplex 
    (see~\cite[p.61, Definition 5.1]{braess2001finite}, ~\cite[p.97, Definition (4.2.16)]{brenner2008mathematical},~\cite[Definition~11.2]{ern2021finite}). 
\end{remark}





\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:poincarefriedrichsoverfacepatch}
    Suppose that $T, T'$ are two $n$-simplices whose intersection is a common face $F := T_1 \cap T_2$. Then 
    \begin{align*}
        \min\limits_{ c \in \bbR }
        \| u - c \|_{L^{p}(U)}
        &
        \leq 
        2 C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
        \max\left(

            ,
            \frac{ \vol(T_2) }{ \vol(T_1) }

            \frac{\diam(T_2)^n}{n! \vol(T_2)} 
        \right)^{\frac 1 p}
        \max\left( \diam(T_1), \diam(T_2) \right)
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(U)}
        .
    \end{align*}
    for any $u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ with $p \in [1,\infty]$.
\end{lemma}

    
\begin{proof}
    Let $\hat T_1$ be the $n$-simplex whose vertices $v_0=0, v_1=e_1, \dots, v_{n-1} = e_{n-1}, v_n = e_n$ are the origin and the $n$ canonical unit vectors. 
    We let $\hat T_2$ be the $n$-simplex whose vertices are $v_0=0, v_1=e_1, \dots, v_{n-1} = e_{n-1}, v'_n = -e_n$. 
    Write $U := T_1 \cup T_2$ and $\hat U := \hat T_1 \cup \hat T_2$.
    We fix affine homeomorphisms $\Phi_1 : \hat T_1 \rightarrow T_1$ and $\Phi_2 : \hat T_2 \rightarrow T_2$
    which map the convex closure of $v_0, \dots, v_{n-1}$ onto the common face $F$.
    Note that these affine transformations define a bi-Lipschitz mapping $\Phi : \hat U \rightarrow U$. 
    
    Suppose that $u \in W^{1,p}(U)$. Then $\hat u := u \circ \Phi \in W^{1,p}(\hat U)$. 
    We observe 
    \begin{align*}
        \| \nabla \hat u \|_{L^{p}(\hat U)}^{p}
        &=
        \| \nabla \hat u \|_{L^{p}(\hat T_1)}^{p}
        +
        \| \nabla \hat u \|_{L^{p}(\hat T_2)}^{p}
        \\&
        \leq 
        |\det(\Dif \Phi_1)|
        \cdot \| \Dif \Phi_1 \|^{p}
        \cdot 
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(T_1)}^{p}
        +
        |\det(\Dif \Phi_2)|
        \cdot \| \Dif \Phi_2 \|^{p}
        \cdot 
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(T_2)}^{p}
        \\&
        \leq 
        \max\left( 
            |\det(\Dif \Phi_1)|^{-1} \cdot \| \Dif \Phi_1 \|^{p}
            ,
            |\det(\Dif \Phi_2)|^{-1} \cdot \| \Dif \Phi_2 \|^{p}
        \right)
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(U)}^{p}
        .
    \end{align*}
    Hence 
    \begin{align*}
        \| \nabla \hat u \|_{L^{p}(\hat U)}
        &\leq 
        \max\left( 
            |\det(\Dif \Phi_1)|^{-\frac 1 p} \cdot \| \Dif \Phi_1 \|
            ,
            |\det(\Dif \Phi_2)|^{-\frac 1 p} \cdot \| \Dif \Phi_2 \|
        \right)
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(U)}
        .
    \end{align*}
    There exists $\hat w \in W^{1,p}(U)$ such that $\nabla \hat w = \nabla \hat u$ and 
    \begin{align*}
        \| \hat w \|_{L^{p}(\hat U)}
        \leq 
        2 C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
        \| \nabla \hat u \|_{L^{p}(\hat U)}
        .
    \end{align*}
    Next, setting $w = \hat w \circ \Phi^{-1}$, we find $\nabla w = \nabla u$ and 
    \begin{align*}
        \| w \|_{L^{p}(U)}
        \leq 
        \max\left( 
            |\det(\Dif \Phi_1)|
            ,
            |\det(\Dif \Phi_2)|
        \right)^{\frac 1 p}
        \| \hat w \|_{L^{p}(\hat U)}
        .
    \end{align*}
    Abbreviate $D := \max\left( \diam(T_1), \diam(T_2) \right)$. In combination, 
    \begin{align*}
        \| w \|_{L^{p}(U)}
        &\leq 
        2 C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
        \max\left(

        \right)^{\frac 1 p}
        \min\left( 
            |\det(\Dif \Phi_1)|
            ,
            |\det(\Dif \Phi_2)| 
        \right)^{-\frac 1 p} 
        D
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(U)}
        \\&
        \leq 
        2 C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
        \max\left( 
            \frac{ |\det(\Dif \Phi_1)| }{ |\det(\Dif \Phi_2)| }
            ,
            \frac{ |\det(\Dif \Phi_2)| }{ |\det(\Dif \Phi_1)| }
        \right)^{\frac 1 p}
        D
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(U)}
        \\&
        \leq 
        2 C_{\rm{EFNT},p}
        \max\left( 
            \frac{ \vol(T_1) }{ \vol(T_2) }
            ,
            \frac{ \vol(T_2) }{ \vol(T_1) }
        \right)^{\frac 1 p}
        D
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(U)}
        .
    \end{align*}
    This gives the desired result.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 Let $u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$. 
 For each $F \in \calT$ of dimension $n-1$, 
 we let $u_F \in W^{1,p}(U_F)$ such that $\nabla u_F = \nabla u$ over $U_F$ and such that $\| u_F \|_{L^{p}(U_F)} \leq C_{{\rm{P}},F} \| \nabla u_F \|_{L^{p}(U_F)}$.
 
 Since $\calT$ is strongly connected, there exists an enumeration of $n$-simplices $T_0, T_1, \dots, T_M$ such that for any $1 \leq m \leq M$ there exists some fixed but arbitrary $0 \leq j(m) < m$ such that $F_m := T_m \cap T_{j(m)}$ is a face of dimension $n-1$. We write $\Omega_m := \cup_{j=0}^{m} T_m$. Hence $\Omega = \Omega_M$. 
 
 
%  We let $T \in \calT$ be the first $n$-simplex. 
%  There exists We already have 
 
 Suppose that $1 \leq m \leq M$ such that there exists $w_{m-1} \in W^{1,p}(\Omega_{m-1})$ with $\nabla w_{m-1} = \nabla u$ over $\Omega_m$. Hence $c_{\star} := w_{m-1} - u_{|\Omega_{m-1}}$ is a constant. 
 By assumption, $T_{m}$ shares the face $F_{m}$ with $T_{j(m)}$. 
 Since $\nabla u_{F_{m}|T_{j(m)}} = \nabla w_{m-1|T_{j(m)}}$,
 there exists a constant $c_{m} := w_{m-1|T_{j(m)}} - u_{F_{m}|T_{j(m)}}$.
 We define $u'_{F_m} := u_{F_m} + c_{m} \in W^{1,p}(U_F)$.
 By construction, $\nabla u'_{F_m} = \nabla u_{F_m} = \nabla u_{|U_{F_m}}$ and $u_{F_{m}|T_{j(m)}} = w_{m-1|T_{j(m)}}$. 
 But that already implies $u'_{F_m} = u_{|F_m} - c_{\star}$. 
 As we define a measurable function $u'_{\star} \in W^{1,p}(\Omega_m)$ by extending $w_{m-1}$ with $u'_{F_m|T_m}$.
 Moreover, 
 \begin{gather*}
    \| u'_{F_m} \|_{L^{p}(T_m)}
    \leq 
    \| u_{F_m} \|_{L^{p}(T_m)}
    +
    \| c_{m} \|_{L^{p}(T_m)},
    \qquad 
    \| c_{m} \|_{L^{p}(T_m)}
    \leq 
    \frac{ \vol(T_m)^{\frac 1 p} }{ \vol(T_{j(m)})^{\frac 1 p} }
    \| c_{m} \|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})},
    \\ 
    \| c_{m} \|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})}
    \leq 
    \| w_{m-1}\|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})} + \| u_{F_{m}} \|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})} 
    .
 \end{gather*}
 In particular,
 \begin{align*}
    \| w_{m} \|_{L^{p}(T_m)}
    \leq 
    \| u_{F_m} \|_{L^{p}(T_m)}
    +
    \frac{ \vol(T_m)^{\frac 1 p} }{ \vol(T_{j(m)})^{\frac 1 p} }
    \| u_{F_{m}} \|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})}
    +
    \frac{ \vol(T_m)^{\frac 1 p} }{ \vol(T_{j(m)})^{\frac 1 p} }
    \| w_{m-1}\|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})}
    .
 \end{align*}
 We want to summarize the two integrals of $u_{F_m}$. 
 In the special case $p=1$,
 \begin{align*}
    \| w_{m} \|_{L^{1}(T_m)}
    \leq 
    \max\left(
        1, \frac{ \vol(T_m) }{ \vol(T_{j(m)}) } 
    \right)
    \| u_{F_m} \|_{L^{1}(U_{F_m})}
    +
    \frac{ \vol(T_m) }{ \vol(T_{j(m)}) }
    \| w_{m-1}\|_{L^{1}(T_{j(m)})}
    .
 \end{align*}
 In the special case $p=\infty$, 
 \begin{align*}
    \| w_{m} \|_{L^{\infty}(T_m)}
    \leq 
    2
    \| u_{F_m} \|_{L^{\infty}(U_{F_m})}
    +
    \| w_{m-1}\|_{L^{\infty}(T_{j(m)})}
    .
 \end{align*}
 When $1 < p < \infty$, letting $q$ be the complementary exponent, we observe 
 \begin{align*}
    \| w_{m} \|_{L^{p}(T_m)}
    &\leq 
    \left( 1 + \frac{ \vol(T_m)^{\frac q p} }{ \vol(T_{j(m)})^{\frac q p} } \right)^{\frac 1 q}
    \left( 
        \| u_{F_m} \|_{L^{p}(T_m)}^{p}
        +
        \| u_{F_{m}} \|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})}^{p}
    \right)^{\frac 1 p}
    +
    \frac{ \vol(T_m)^{\frac 1 p} }{ \vol(T_{j(m)})^{\frac 1 p} }
    \| w_{m-1}\|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})}
    \\&\leq 
    \left( 1 + \frac{ \vol(T_m)^{\frac q p} }{ \vol(T_{j(m)})^{\frac q p} } \right)^{\frac 1 q}
    \| u_{F_m} \|_{L^{p}(U_{F_m})} 
    +
    \frac{ \vol(T_m)^{\frac 1 p} }{ \vol(T_{j(m)})^{\frac 1 p} }
    \| w_{m-1}\|_{L^{p}(T_{j(m)})}
    .
 \end{align*}
 Recursive application provides the following estimate:
 if $T_0 = S_0, S_1, \dots, S_m = T_m$ is a sequence of $n$-simplices in $\calT$
 such that \color{red}$S_{t-1}$ precedes $S_{t}$ in the graph \color{black} and such that $F_t = S_t \cap S_{t-1}$,
 then 
 \begin{align*}
    \| w_{m} \|_{L^{p}(S_m)}
    &\leq 
    \sum_{t=1}^{m} 
    \left( 
        \prod_{t < l \leq m} 
        \frac{ \vol(S_l)^{\frac 1 p} }{ \vol(S_{l-1})^{\frac 1 p} } 
    \right)
    \left( 1 + \frac{ \vol(S_t)^{\frac q p} }{ \vol(S_{t-1})^{\frac q p} } \right)^{\frac 1 q}
    \| u_{F_t} \|_{L^{p}(U_{F_t})}
    \\&\quad \quad \quad 
    +
    \left( 
        \prod_{0 < l \leq m} 
        \frac{ \vol(S_l)^{\frac 1 p} }{ \vol(S_{l-1})^{\frac 1 p} } 
    \right)
    \| u_{S_0}\|_{L^{p}(S_{0})}
    .
 \end{align*}
 It follows that
 \begin{align*}
    \| w_{m} \|_{L^{p}(S_m)}^{p}
    &\leq 
    (m+1)^{p-1}
    \sum_{t=1}^{m} 
    \left( 
        \prod_{t < l \leq m} 
        \frac{ \vol(S_l) }{ \vol(S_{l-1}) } 
    \right)
    \left( 1 + \frac{ \vol(S_t)^{\frac q p} }{ \vol(S_{t-1})^{\frac q p} } \right)^{p/q}
    \| u_{F_t} \|_{L^{p}(U_{F_t})}^{p}
    \\&\quad \quad \quad 
    +
    (m+1)^{p-1}
    \left( 
        \prod_{0 < l \leq m} 
        \frac{ \vol(S_l) }{ \vol(S_{l-1}) } 
    \right)
    \| u_{S_0}\|_{L^{p}(S_{0})}^{p}
    .
 \end{align*}
 Notice that $p/q = p - 1$.
\end{proof}

Upper bound for the classical Poincar\'e inequality over a simplex is easily found. 
We can use it to compute an upper bound for the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs inequality 
when homogeneous boundary conditions are imposed on a single face of the boundary. 

\begin{lemma}
    Let $T$ be an $n$-simplex and with a face $F$. 
    If $u \in W^{1,p}(T)$ such that $\trace_{F} u = 0$, then 
    \begin{align*}
        \| u \|_{L^{p}(T)}
        &
        \leq 
        C_{\partial,p}
        \diam(T) \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(T)}
    \end{align*}
    where 
    \begin{align*}
        C_{\partial,p}
        \leq 
        \left( C_{?} + \left( C_{?}^{p} + p \cdot C_{?}^{p-1} \right)^{\frac 1 p} \right) 
        .
    \end{align*}
    % \begin{align*}
    %     \| u \|_{L^{p}(T)}
    %     &
    %     \leq 
    %     C_{?} \diam(T)
    %     \| \nabla w \|_{\bfL^{p}(T)}
    %     +
    %     \| \gamma \|_{\bfL^{p}(T)}
    %     \\&
    %     \leq 
    %     C_{?} \diam(T)
    %     \| \nabla u \|_{\bfL^{p}(T)}
    %     +
    %     \left( C_{?}^{p} + p \cdot C_{?}^{p-1} \right)^{\frac 1 p}
    %     \diam(T)
    %     \| \nabla w \|_{L^{p}(T)}
    %     \\&
    %     \leq 
    %     C_{?} 
    %     \diam(T) \| \nabla u \|_{\bfL^{p}(T)}
    %     +
    %     \left( C_{?}^{p} + p \cdot C_{?}^{p-1} \right)^{\frac 1 p}
    %     \diam(T) \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(T)}
    %     \\&
    %     \leq 
    %     \left( C_{?} + \left( C_{?}^{p} + p \cdot C_{?}^{p-1} \right)^{\frac 1 p} \right) 
    %     \diam(T) \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(T)}
    %     .
    % \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    There exists $w \in W^{1,p}(T)$ with $\nabla w = \nabla u$ and 
    \[
        \| w \|_{L^{p}(T)}
        \leq 
        C_{?}
        \| \nabla w \|_{\bfL^{p}(T)}
        .
    \]
    Then $w-u$ is constant, and thus $\gamma := \trace_{F} (w-u) = \trace_{F} w$. 
    We use that 
    \[
        \| \gamma \|_{L^{p}(T)}
        =
        \gamma \vol(T)^\frac{1}{p}
        =
        \left( \frac{ \vol(T) }{ \vol(F) } \right)^\frac{1}{p}
        \cdot 
        \gamma 
        \vol(F)^\frac{1}{p}
        \leq 
        \left( \frac{ \vol(T) }{ \vol(F) } \right)^\frac{1}{p}
        \| \gamma \|_{L^{p}(F)}
        .
    \]
    Using a trace inequality~\cite[Lemma~2.8]{veeser2012poincare} when $1 \leq p < \infty$, we find 
    \begin{align*}
        \| \gamma \|_{L^{p}(F)}^{p}
        &
        \leq 
        \frac{ \vol(F) }{ \vol(T) }
        \| w \|_{L^{p}(T)}^{p}
        +
        p
        \cdot 
        \diam(T)
        \frac{ \vol(F) }{ \vol(T) }
        \| w \|_{L^{p}(T)}^{p-1}
        \| \nabla w \|_{L^{p}(T)}
        \\&
        \leq 
        \left( C_{?}^{p} + p \cdot C_{?}^{p-1} \right) 
        \diam(T)^{p}
        \left( \frac{ \vol(F) }{ \vol(T) } \right)
        \| \nabla w \|_{L^{p}(T)}^{p}
        .
    \end{align*}
    Recall that $u = w - \gamma$. The desired result follows. 
\end{proof}

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$. 
    Since $\calT$ is strongly connected, there exists an enumeration of $n$-simplices $T_0, T_1, \dots, T_M$ such that for any $1 \leq m \leq M$ there exists some fixed but arbitrary $0 \leq j(m) < m$ such that $F_m := T_m \cap T_{j(m)}$ is a face of dimension $n-1$. 
    We write $\Omega_m := \cup_{j=0}^{m} T_m$. Hence $\Omega = \Omega_M$. 
    
    First, there exists $w_0 \in W^{1,p}(T_{0})$ such that $\nabla w_{0} = \nabla u$ over $\Omega_0$. 
    Suppose that $0 \leq m < M$ such that there exists $w_{m} \in W^{1,p}(\Omega_{m})$ with $\nabla w_{m} = \nabla u$ over $\Omega_m$. 
    Hence $w_{m} - u_{|\Omega_{m}}$ is a constant. 
    
    By assumption, $T_{m}$ shares the face $F_{m}$ with $T_{j(m)}$. 
    Let $\hat T$ be the reference simplex.
    We fix affine homeomorphisms $\Phi : \hat T \rightarrow T_{j(m)}$ and $\Theta : \hat T \rightarrow T_{m+1}$,
    each of which maps the convex closure of $v_0, \dots, v_{n-1}$ onto the common face $F_{m}$.
    We define $w'_{m+1} := w_{{m}} \circ \Phi \circ \Theta^{-1} \in W^{1,p}(T_{m+1})$. 
    %
    {\color{blue}We define $w'_{m+1} := w_{m} \circ \Xi \in W^{1,p}(T_{m+1})$,
    where $\Xi : T_{m+1} \rightarrow T_{j(m)}$ is the unique affine homeomorphism that leaves $F$ invariant. }
    %
    By construction, $w'_{m+1} \in W^{1,p}(T_{m+1})$ with 
    \begin{align*}
        \trace_F w_{m} = \trace_F w'_{m+1}
        .
    \end{align*}
    Suppose that $w''_{m+1} = u - w'_{m+1} \in W^{1,p}(T_{m+1})$.
    It satisfies 
    \begin{align*}
        \nabla w''_{m+1} = \nabla u - \nabla w'_{m+1}, 
        \quad 
        \trace_{F_{m}} w''_{m+1} = 0.
    \end{align*}
    The trace condition holds because 
    \begin{align*}
        \trace_{F_{m}}( \nabla u - \nabla w'_{m+1} ) 
        &= 
        \trace_{F_{m}} \nabla u - \trace_{F_{m}} \nabla w'_{m+1}
        \\&= 
        \nabla \trace_{F_{m}} u - \nabla \trace_{F_{m}} w'_{m+1}
        = 
        \nabla \trace_{F_{m}} u - \nabla \trace_{F_{m}} w_{m}
        = 
        0
        .
    \end{align*}
    Setting $w_{m+1} := w_{m}$ over $\Omega_{m}$ and $w_{m+1} := w'_{m+1} + w''_{m+1}$ over $T_{m+1}$, 
    we find 
    \begin{gather*}
        \nabla w_{m+1} = \nabla w'_{m+1} + \nabla w''_{m+1} = \nabla w'_{m+1} + \nabla u - \nabla w'_{m+1} = \nabla u,
        % \end{gather*}
        \\
        % \begin{gather*}
        \trace_{F_{m}} w_{m+1} = \trace_{F_{m}} w'_{m+1} = \trace_{F_{m}} w_{m}.
    \end{gather*}
    That means that $w_{m+1} \in W^{1,p}(\Omega_{m+1})$ with $\nabla w_{m+1} = \nabla u$ over $\Omega_{m+1}$. 
    As we will show soon, there exists $D_{m+1} > 0$ such that 
    \begin{gather*}
        \| u''_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})} 
        \leq 
        D_{m+1} \diam(T_{m+1}) \cdot \| \nabla u - \nabla u'_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})}.
    \end{gather*}
    Therefore, 
    \begin{align*}
        \| u''_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})}  
        &
        \leq 
        D_{m+1} \diam(T_{m+1}) \| \nabla u        \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})} 
        + 
        D_{m+1} \diam(T_{m+1}) \| \nabla u'_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})} 
        .
    \end{align*}
    We use also the inequality 
    \begin{align*}
        \| \nabla u'_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})}
        &\leq 
        |\det(\Dif \Phi  )|^{-\frac 1 p} \cdot \| \Dif \Phi   \|
        \cdot 
        |\det(\Dif \Theta)|^{ \frac 1 p} \cdot \| \Dif \Theta^{-1} \|
        \| \nabla u_{m} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m})}
        .
    \end{align*}
    Putting this all together, 
    \begin{align*}
        \| \nabla u'_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})}
        &\leq 
        \frac{ \vol(T_{m+1})^{\frac 1 p} }{ \vol(T_{m})^{\frac 1 p} } 
        \cdot 
        \| \Dif \Phi   \|
        \cdot 
        \| \Dif \Theta^{-1} \|
        \| \nabla u_{m} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m})}
        .
    \end{align*}
    % TODO: Finish the recursion 
    
    
    We construct such a $u''_{m+1} \in W^{1,p}(T_{m+1})$ satisfying desirable bounds.
    There exists $\Psi : \hat T \rightarrow T_{m+1}$ mapping the convex closure of the $n$ unit vectors onto the face $F$.
    We define $\hat g \in \bfL^p(\hat T)$ via $\hat g := \nabla ( u \circ \Psi - u'_{m+1} \circ \Psi )$. 
    Let $\hat U$ be the unit ball of the $\ell^1$ metric, which contains $\hat T$,
    and extend that $\hat g$ onto $\hat U$ by reflection across the coordinate axes. 
    By construction, $\hat g$ is the gradient of a unique function in $w \in W^{1,p}$ that vanishes at the boundary of $\hat U$,
    which satisfies Friedrichs inequality. In total, we utilize 
    \begin{gather*}
        \| u''_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})}
        \leq 
        |\det(\Dif \Psi)|^{-\frac 1 p} \cdot \| \Dif \Psi \|
        \| w \|_{L^{p}(\hat T)}
        ,
        \qquad 
        \| w \|_{L^{p}(\hat U)} 
        \leq 
        2 
        \| \hat g \|_{\bfL^{p}(\hat U)}
        ,
        \\
        \| \hat g \|_{\bfL^{p}(\hat U)}
        \leq 
        2^{\frac n p}
        \| \hat g \|_{\bfL^{p}(\hat T)}
        \leq 
        2^{\frac n p}
        |\det(\Dif \Psi_1)|^{-\frac 1 p} \cdot \| \Dif \Psi_1 \|
        \| \nabla u - \nabla u'_{m+1} \|_{\bfL^{p}(T)}
        .
    \end{gather*}
    We thus have
    \begin{align*}
        \| u''_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})}
        &
        \leq 
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})} 
        + 
        2^{1+\frac n p}
        |\det(\Dif \Psi)|^{-\frac 1 p} \cdot \| \Dif \Psi \|
        |\det(\Dif \Psi)|^{-\frac 1 p} \cdot \| \Dif \Psi \|
        \| \nabla u'_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})}
        \\&
        \leq 
        \| \nabla u \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})} 
        + 
        2^{1+\frac n p}
        \| \Dif \Psi \|
        \| \Dif \Psi \|
        \| \nabla u'_{m+1} \|_{L^{p}(T_{m+1})}
        .
    \end{align*}
    We will also use the bound.  
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The previous result depends on only a few parameters of the triangulation:
    the length of any traversal from the root simplex,
    the ratios of the volumes of adjacent simplices,
    the Poincar\'e constants on each face patch, and the Poincar\'e constant of the initial simplex. 
    The aforementioned local Poincar\'e constants can generally be estimated in terms of shape-parameters. 
    If the face patches of the triangulation are convex, then better estimates are possible.

\section{Shellable triangulations}\label{section:advancedtriangulations}

We return to the theory of triangulations,
as our main objective requires some further concepts.
We are interested in simplicial complexes that triangulated manifolds. 
We put particular focus on \emph{shellable} simplicial complexes as a particularly important class of complexes. Such simplicial complexes are constructed by successively adding simplices in a particularly well-behaved manner. Patches within triangulations are examples of such shellable complexes. 
Our main references for this section are the monographs by Kozlov~\cite{kozlov2008combinatorial} and Ziegler~\cite{ziegler2012lectures}. 

\subsection{Triangulations of manifolds}

We define an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex to be a \emph{manifold triangulation} if the underlying set $\underlying{\calT}$ is an $n$-dimensional manifold with boundary.
We recall that this means that for every $x \in \underlying{\calT}$
there exists $\epsilon > 0$ and an embedding $\phi : \Ball_\epsilon(x) \cap \underlying{\calT} \rightarrow \bbR^n$
such that $\phi(0) = 0$ and $\phi$ is an isomorphism either onto the closed unit ball $\calB = \{ x \in \bbR^n \suchthat |x| \leq 1 \}$
or onto $\{ x \in \calB \suchthat x_1 \geq 0 \}$.
Any simplicial complex that triangulates an $n$-dimensional manifold must be $n$-dimensional.

We know that any manifold $\calM$ has a got a topological boundary $\partial\calM$, possibly empty. 
If $\calM$ is $n$-dimensional, then the $\partial\calM$ is a topological manifold without boundary of dimension $n-1$. 

The following special cases receive particular interest:
a \textit{$n$-ball triangulation} is any triangulation of a topological (closed) $n$-ball,
and we sometimes call this a \textit{$n$-disk} triangulation.
An \textit{$n$-sphere triangulation} is any triangulation of a topological $n$-sphere. 

We gather a few helpful properties of manifold triangulations. 
While the reader might deem them obvious, we nevertheless include proofs. 
We begin with the boundary.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:boundarysimplices}
    Let $\calT$ be a finite $n$-dimensional simplicial complex whose underlying space is a manifold $\calM$. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Any face $F \in \Faces(\calT)$ is not contained in the boundary if and only if it is contained in exactly two $n$-simplices.
        \item Any face $F \in \Faces(\calT)$ is contained in the boundary if and only if it is contained in exactly one $n$-simplex.
        \item The simplices contained in the boundary constitute a triangulation of the boundary.
        % \item $\calT$ is non-branching, that is, every $F \in \calT$ of dimension $n-1$ is contained in at most two $n$-simplices of $\calT$. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We prove these statements in several steps.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    We $\mathring \calM := \calM \setminus \partial \calM$ denote the interior of the manifold. 
    We will use the following fact: if $S \in \calT$ has an inner point that lies on $\partial \calM$, then all inner points of $S$ are on $\partial \calM$. 
    Since the boundary is closed, every $S \in \calT$ is either a subset of the boundary or all its inner points lie in the interior $\mathring \calM$ of the manifold. 
    
    \item
    Let $F \in \Faces(T)$ and let $z_F \in F$ be its midpoint. 
    Let $\mathring B_F$ be an open neighborhood around $z_F$ so small that it only intersects those $n$-simplices of $\calT$ that already contain $z_F$ and no faces other than $F$.
    Suppose there are distinct $n$-simplices $T_1, T_2, \dots, T_K$ that contain $z_F$. 
    The intersection of any two of them is $F$, and their interiors are disjoint. 
    
    If $z_F$ is an interior point of $\calM$, 
    then we can assume that $\mathring B_F$ is homeomorphic to an open $n$-ball and $\partial \mathring B_F$ is homeomorphic to a sphere $S$ of dimension $n-1$. 
    At the same time, $X = F \subseteq \partial \mathring B_F$ is empty if $n=1$ or homeomorphic to a sphere $S' \subseteq S$ of dimension $n-2$. 
    We see that $\partial \mathring B_F \setminus X$ has $K$ distinct connected components. 
    But by construction $\partial \mathring B_F \setminus X$ is homeomorphic to $S \setminus S'$,
    which has exactly two distinct connected components according to the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem.
    We conclude that $F$ is contained in two $n$-simplices of $\calT$.
    If an inner face $F$ were contained in only one $n$-simplex,
    then we could construct a homeomorphism from the $n$-ball onto itself that maps an interior point on the its boundary, which cannot be.
    So each inner face is contained in exactly two $n$-simplices. 
    
    If $F$ is contained in only one $n$-simplex, then it must be a face in the boundary of $\calM$. 
    If $F$ were contained in at least two $n$-simplices,
    then we could construct a homeomorphism from the $n$-ball onto itself that maps an interior point on the its boundary, which cannot be.
    So each face within $\partial \calM$ is contained in exactly one $n$-simplex. 
    
    \item
    Clearly, the simplices of $\calT$ contained in the boundary constitute a simplicial complex. 
    If $x \in \partial \calM$ is a boundary simplex, then it is an inner point of some simplex $S \in \calT$.
    But then this simplex must be a boundary simplex, so the boundary simplices form a triangulation of $\partial \calM$.
    \end{enumerate}
    All relevant results are proven. 
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TODO: integrate into narrative 
Suppose that $\calT$ is an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex that triangulates a manifold. 
Those simplices of the manifold triangulation that are subsets of the boundary of the underlying manifold are called \emph{boundary simplices}. 
% The simplices that lie in the boundary of the underlying set are called \emph{boundary simplices}.
All other simplices of the manifold triangulation are called \emph{inner simplices}. 

We have seen that the boundary simplices of a manifold triangulation constitute a triangulation of the manifolds boundary. 
We call this simplicial complex the \emph{boundary complex}. It has dimension $n-1$. 
% We see that the family of boundary faces constitute a simplicial complex, which we call \textit{boundary complex}.
% Any point on the boundary lies within some boundary simplex, and hence the boundary complex is a triangulation of the boundary. 
% Definitions imply that the boundary complex is a manifold triangulation of dimension $n-1$.
% The boundary simplices of a manifold triangulation of dimension $n$ constitute a manifold triangulation themselves, of dimension $n-1$, which triangulate the boundary of the underlying space. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\\

We continue with a few more observations about manifold triangulations.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:startopology}
    Let $\calT$ be a finite $n$-dimensional simplicial complex whose underlying space is a manifold $\calM$. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $S$ is an inner simplex, then $\patch_{\calT}(S)$ is a simplicial $n$-ball with $S$ as an inner simplex
        and $\carapace_{\calT}(S)$ is a simplicial $(n-1)$-sphere. 
        \item If $S$ is a boundary subsimplex, then $\patch_{\calT}(S)$ is a simplicial $n$-ball with $S$ as a boundary simplex,
        and $\carapace_{\calT}(S)$ is a simplicial $(n-1)$-ball.
        \item If the underlying space of $\calT$ is connected, then $\calT$ is strongly connected.
    \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We prove these statements in several steps.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    Let $S$ be any simplex with vertices $v_0, v_1, \dots, v_k$, with midpoint $z_F$, and dimension $k$.
    Let $\calS := \patch_{\calT}(S)$ be its star. 
    Each $l$-dimensional simplex $T \in \calS$ that contains $S$ 
    has vertices $v_0, v_1, \dots, v_k, v_{k+1}^{S}, \dots, v_{l}^{S}$. 
    For any such simplex, we introduce a decomposition $T_{0}, \dots, T_{k}$, where each $T_{i}$ has vertices 
    \begin{align*}
        v_0, \dots, v_{i-1}, z_F, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_k, v_{k+1}^{S}, \dots, v_{l}^{S}.
    \end{align*}
    The collection $\calS'$ of these simplices and their subsimplices constitute a simplicial complex 
    that triangulates the same underlying set as $\calS$.
    Moreover, $\calS' = \patch_{\calS'}(z_F)$. 
    In particular, $z_F$ is a boundary vertex of $\calS'$ if and only if $S$ is a boundary simplex of $\calS$. 
    
    So it remains to study the topology of vertex stars. Suppose that $S = \{z\}$ is a singleton simplex. 
    For $\delta > 0$ small enough, 
    \begin{align*}
        B_{\delta}(z) = \left\{ x \in \calM \suchthat d(x,z) \leq \delta \right\},
        \quad 
        S_{\delta}(z) = \left\{ x \in \calM \suchthat d(x,z) = \delta \right\},
    \end{align*}
    are subsets of $\patch_{\calT}(S)$.
    For each $K \in \patch_{\calT}(S)$ that contains $S$ and which has the complementary simplex $F_S$, 
    we easily find homeomorphisms $\phi_{K} : B_{\delta}(z) \cap K \rightarrow K$
    such that 
    $\phi_{K|S}$ is the identity,
    such that 
    $\phi_{K}(S_F) = S_{\delta}(z)$,
    and such that 
    for all $K, K' \in \calT$ with $K' \subseteq K$ we have $\phi_{K|K'} = \phi_{K'}$. 
    
    If $z$ is an inner vertex of $\calS'$, 
    then the boundary simplices of $\calS'$,
    which are the boundary simplices of $\calS$, triangulate a topological sphere of dimension $n-1$.
    
    If $z$ is a boundary vertex of $\calS'$,
    which is the case if and only if $S$ is a boundary simplex, 
    then the underlying space of $\carapace(S)$ is homeomorphic to $S_{\delta}(z)$, 
    which is a topological ball of dimension $n-1$. % TODO: explain why
    
    \item 
    We show that each vertex star is strongly connected via a short induction argument.
    Clearly, any simplicial $1$-ball and simplicial $1$-sphere is strongly connected. 
    Now, if $n \geq 1$, then any vertex star in an $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold triangulation is strongly connected if all simplicial $n$-balls and $n$-spheres are strongly connected.
    The induction argument implies that each vertex star in $\calT$ is strongly connected.

    \item 
    If the underlying space is connected, then we easily see that the underlying space of the $1$-skeleton is path-connected.
    Given $n$-simplices $S,S' \in \calT$, 
    we can thus choose a sequence of $\hat S_0=S,\hat S_1,\dots,\hat S_m=S' \in \calT$ such that $\hat S_{i} \cap \hat S_{i-1} \neq \emptyset$ for all $1 \leq i \leq m$.
    We also notice that each vertex star is strongly connected. 
    We can thus construct change the first sequence to another $S_0=S,S_1,\dots,S'=S_m \in \calT$ 
    such that $S_{i} \cap S_{i-1}$ is a face of both $S_{i}$ and $S_{i-1}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq m$.
    \end{enumerate}
    All relevant results are proven. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    Clearly, not every simplicial complex is the triangulation of some (embedded) topological manifold with or without boundary. 
    Whether a simplicial complex is the triangulation of a manifold is algorithmically undecidable. 
    We therefore are not in pursuit of any easy combinatorial property that indicates whether a simplicial complex (without any further specific assumptions) triangulates a manifold.

    Conversely, not all topological manifolds, even if compact, can be described as a triangulation. 
    Such manifolds appear in dimension four and higher:
    one example is the E8 manifold, which is a compact simply-connected topological $4$-manifold that is homeomorphic to the underlying set of any simplicial complex. The construction of such counterexamples typically involves an infinite procedure.
%     For each dimension $n \geq 5$ there exists an $n$-dimensional compact topological manifold without a triangulation.

% 3. Shellability 
\subsection{Shellable simplicial complexes}

We turn our attention to a different idea of how to incrementally construct a simplicial complex while maintaining well-behaved intermediate complexes. 
We build upon the notion of shelling, as introduced in~\cite[Definition 8.1]{ziegler2012lectures}.
Our definition of shelling is equivalent to the notion of the shellings of simplicial complexes in the aforementioned reference; see also~\cite[Remark~8.3]{ziegler2012lectures}. 

Suppose that $\calT$ is an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex and we have an enumeration of the $n$-simplices $T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2}, \dots \in \subsimplex_{n}(\calT)$.
For any enumeration, we call 
\[
    I_m 
    := 
    \big( 
        T_{0} \cup T_{1} \cup \dots \cup T_{m} 
    \big) 
    \cap 
    T_{m+1}
\]
be the $m$-th \textit{interface set}. 
% Note that this intersection is automatically a subcomplex of the boundary complex of the last simplex $T_{m}$.
We call the enumeration a \emph{shelling} if each interface $I_m$ is a manifold of dimension $n-1$. 

\begin{remark}
    We interpret a shelling as the construction of a triangulation 
    by successively attaching simplices such that the intermediate triangulations are well-behaved. 
    Conversely, the reverse enumeration describes a successive decomposition of the triangulation, hence the name ``shelling''.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Whether a simplicial complex is shellable can be checked, in principle, simply by trying out all the possibly enumerations.
    That we cannot do much better than this is captured in the result that testing for shellability is NP-complete~\cite{goaoc2019shellability}:
    this complexity result is even true if we merely consider simplicial complexes of dimension two embedded in some Euclidean space.
\end{remark}




The reason of our interest in shellable simplicial complexes is that they can be constructed by successive adhesion of simplices to intermediate complexes, 
such that the interface is well-behaved: it is a simplicial disk or a simplicial sphere. 
That leads to the following important consequence.

% TODO: we only need some basic properties, namely that the construction maintains manifolds with boundary.
% TODO: copy and adapt the content of Ziegler and Kozlov as necessary
% The notion of shelling is taken from Ziegler's book~\cite{ziegler2012lectures}

\begin{lemma}    
    If an $n$-dimensional simplicial complex $\calT$ has a shelling $T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2}, \dots, T_{M}$ and is non-branching, 
    then
    $$
        X_{m} := T_{0} \cup T_{1} \cup \dots \cup T_{m}
    $$ 
    is a manifold with boundary for all $0 \leq m \geq M$.
    % 
    In particular, $X_{m}$ is a topological $n$-ball when $m < M$, 
    and 
    $X_{M}$ is either a topological $n$-ball or topological $n$-sphere. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}  
    We prove this claim by induction. 
    Certainly, if $\calT$ contains only one single $n$-simplex, then it is a shellable triangulation of a topological $n$-ball. 
    Suppose that $X_m := T_{0} \cup T_{1} \cup \dots \cup T_{m}$ is a topological $n$-ball and that $T_{m+1}$ is the next $n$-simplex in the shelling.
    By definition, $I_{m+1} := X_{m} \cap T_{m+1}$ is a submanifold of $\partial T_{m+1}$,
    and it is triangulated by some faces of $T_{m+1}$ and their subsimplices. 
    
    Let $F$ be such a face. 
    By assumption, $F$ must be contained in exactly one $n$-simplex of $T_{0}, T_{1}, \dots, T_{m}$,
    and $F$ is in the boundary of $X_{m}$. We conclude that $I_{m}$ triangulates a submanifold of the boundary of $X_{m}$.
    
    On the one hand, 
    if $I_{m+1}$ is the entire boundary of $T_{m+1}$, 
    then it must also be the boundary of the topological $n$-ball $X_{m}$. 
    Hence $X_{m} \cup T_{m+1}$ must be a topological $n$-sphere and thus a manifold without boundary, which requires $m = M$.
    On the other hand, 
    if $I_{m+1}$ is a proper subset of the entire boundary of $T_{m+1}$, 
    then $X_{m} \cup T_{m+1}$ is still a topological $n$-ball.
\end{proof}






We collect important examples of shellable triangulations.
Our main interest are local patches or stars within triangulations. 

\begin{example}
    Any simplex $T$ trivially has a shelling. The boundary complex $\partial \calT(T)$ has a shelling:
    in fact, any enumeration of the boundary faces of $T$ constitutes a shelling.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    The standard triangulation of the $n$-dimensional cube, the Kuhn triangulation, is shellable. 
    % https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=de&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=kuhn+triangulation+shelling&btnG=
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}    
    Any simplicial $2$-disk is shellable.
    Any simplicial $2$-sphere is shellable. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    First, 
    let $\calS$ be any triangulation of a $2$-sphere. 
    By removing any triangle $S \in \calS$, we obtain a triangulation $\calT$ of a $2$-disk.
    Any shelling of that disk can be extended to a shelling of $\calS$ by re-inserting the first triangle $S$.
    So it remains to show that any triangulation $\calT$ of the two-dimensional disk is shellable. 
    We will construct the shelling in reverse. 
    
    Write $M = |\calT|$. 
    We call a triangle $T \in \calT$ \emph{good} if it intersects the boundary $\partial M$ in a non-empty union of edges. 
    We show by an induction argument over the number of triangles that every triangulation of a $2$-disk contains a good triangle. 
    Clearly, this is the case if the triangulation contains only one triangle. 
    Now suppose the induction claim is true when the triangulation includes $N$ triangles,
    and assume that $\calT$ includes $N+1$ triangles. 
    There exists a triangle $T' \in \calT$ with at least one edge in the boundary. 
    If $T'$ is good, then we are already done. 
    Otherwise, $T'$ intersects the boundary at one edge and its opposing vertex.
    Removing $T'$ splits the manifold into two pieces, each of which is a topological $2$-disk.
    By the induction assumption, they contain a good triangle.
    
    Since $\calT$ triangulates a $2$-disk,
    it contains a good triangle $T$. 
    If $T$ has three edges in the boundary, then $T = M$ and we are trivially done. 
    If $T$ intersects with the boundary in exactly one or two edges, 
    then $\overline{M \setminus T}$ is still a topological $2$-disk.
    Letting $\calT'$ be the triangulation obtained by removing $T$,
    we have another triangulation of the $2$-disk that intersects $T$ only at either two or one edges.
    Any shelling of $\calT'$ can be extended to a shelling of $\calT$.
%     Let $\calT$ be a simplicial $2$-disk. 
%     If $\calT$ contains only one triangle, then there is nothing to show. 
%     Otherwise, there exists at least one triangle $T$ that touches the boundary of the disk at either one or two edges 
%     {\color{red}Needs proof}. 
%   
%     Now let $\calS$ be any simplicial $2$-sphere. 
%     By removing any triangle $S \in \calS$, we obtain a simplicial $2$-disk, which is shellable. 
%     Any of its shellings can be extended to a shelling of $\calS$ by re-inserting the first triangle $S$.
\end{proof}

% TODO: Ziegler, Lemma 8.7: if a complex has a shelling, then this gives a shelling of the stars 

\begin{lemma}
    Let $\calT$ be a $n$-dimensional manifold triangulation and $V \in \Vertices(\calT)$ be an inner vertex.
    Then $\patch_{\calT}(V)$ is shellable. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Without loss of generality, $V$ is the origin. 
    Any ray starting at $V$ intersects at most one vertex of $\patch_{\calT}(V)$.
    We can also assume that all boundary vertices of $\patch_{\calT}(V)$ to be unit vectors,
    which does not affect shellability. 
    The simplicial boundary complex of $\calT$ is the boundary complex of a convex polytope,
    and is thus shellable~\cite{ziegler2012lectures}. % TODO: cite exactly 
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
    Let $\calT$ be a $3$-dimensional manifold triangulation and $S \in \calT$.
    Then $\patch_{\calT}(S)$ is shellable. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The statement is clear if $S$ is an inner or boundary face of $\calT$. 
    The statement is also easily verified if $S$ is an inner or boundary edge of $\calT$.
    When $S$ is an inner vertex, then we apply the preceding lemma. 
    
    It remains to consider the case where $S$ is a boundary vertex. 
    Then the triangles of $\patch_{\calT}(S)$ that do not contain $V$ constitute a simplicial $2$-disk 
    which is shellable,
    and any such shelling can be extended to a shelling of $\patch_{\calT}(S)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
    Not all trianguable sets admit a triangulation that is also shellable. 
    Moreover, even if a set admits a shellable triangulation, not all of its triangulations might be shellable. 
    We refer to~\cite[Example 8.9]{ziegler2012lectures} for an examples of non-shellable triangulations of cubes and tetrahedra in three dimensions. 

    For example, there exists a non-shellable triangulation of a tetrahedron. 
    If we extend this triangulation to a triangulation of a hypertetrahedron by suspending it from a new point $v_\star$, 
    then the resulting new triangulation is non-shellable and coincides with the patch around $v_\star$.
    This demonstrates that patches around boundary simplices are not necessarily shellable when the dimension exceeds $3$.
